- U-shaped max/min thermometers were in use at the BCI Clearing station until December 2010.  
  From Jan. 1st 2011 onwards the U-shaped max/min thermometers were replaced by Individual maximum and minimum thermometers. 

- During the process of phasing-out U-shaped thermometers both Individual Max and Min and U-shaped thermometers were run in parallel.
  For a nine month period the average daily maximum temperature read from the Individual Max thermometer was 30.2 Celsius, while for the same
  period the average daily maximum read from a U-shaped thermometer was 30.5 Celsius, i.e. on average the Individual Max thermometer
  was reading 0.3 Celsius lower.

  From Jan. 1st 2011 onwards the U-shaped max/min thermometers were replaced by Individual maximum and minimum thermometers. 

- During the process of phasing-out U-shaped thermometers both Individual Max and Min and U-shaped thermometers were run in parallel.
  For a nine month period the average daily minimum temperature read from the Individual Min themometer was 23.0 Celsius, while for the same
  period the average daily minimum read from a U-shaped thermometer was 23.4 Celsius, i.e. on average the Individual Min thermometer 
  was reading 0.4 Celsius lower.
